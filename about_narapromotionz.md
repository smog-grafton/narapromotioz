Our mission is to reignite the passion for boxing in Uganda by staging high-quality, professional events that excite fans and create opportunities for our athletes. We are also committed to our community, organizing charity events to support causes such as the development of female boxers and providing resources for under-equipped boxing clubs.
Our History
Since our inception, Nara Promotionz has been at the forefront of the Ugandan boxing scene. Under the leadership of our director, Lubowa Babu Hussein, a respected sports commentator at 90.8 Metro FM, we have established a reputation for excellence and a commitment to the sport.[1]
A cornerstone of our success has been the creation of the "Sweet Science" boxing series. The inaugural event, "Sweet Science Season 1," was held on September 30th, 2023, at Club Obligato in Kampala, and featured a thrilling lineup of professional boxers from Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.[2] This event set the stage for a series of successful fight nights that have become a staple of the Ugandan boxing calendar.
Throughout our history, we have continued to grow, hosting "Sweet Science" seasons 2, 3, and 4, each with bigger and more exciting fight cards. These events have not only provided a platform for local fighters to compete but have also attracted international talent, further raising the profile of Ugandan boxing.[1][3] In addition to our flagship series, Nara Promotionz has also organized ABU (African Boxing Union) title fights, demonstrating our capability to host major international boxing events.[3]

Founded by Lubowa Babu Hussein, Nara Promotionz was born from a desire to address a clear need within the Ugandan sports community for consistent, high-quality professional boxing events. Leveraging his extensive experience in sports media, Hussein established the company to be a catalyst for change, aiming to professionalize the sport and create new opportunities for local athletes.
Nara Promotionz made a significant mark with the launch of its flagship event, the "Sweet Science Boxing Series." The inaugural event, "Sweet Science Season 1," was held on September 30th, 2023, and successfully brought together fighters from Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, immediately establishing the company's regional ambition.[1]
Building on this success, the series has become a staple in the Ugandan boxing calendar.

Through strategic partnerships with media outlets like 90.8 Metro FM and various corporate sponsors, Nara Promotionz has consistently grown its brand and the profile of its fighters.[3] From its base on Kawaala Road, the company continues to plan and execute premier boxing events, solidifying its reputation as a leading and innovative force in African boxing.
